# Automapping

This is a process that automatically creates mappings based on user created mappings.

## `ggrc.automapper`
This defines the entry point `register_automapping_listeners` that registers an event listener that fires on every user-created mapping. Based on the neighbourhood of the two mapped objects it fires the appropriate rules and creates new mappings. The process is then repeated for newly created mappings. This effectively traverses the local relevant subgraph as defined by the rules.

## `ggrc.automapper.rules`

This defines rules for mapping creation as data. This approach allows for automatic sanity checking of the rules which can help prevent unintended blowups of the auto-mappings.
In order to keep automatic mappings under control we impose a tree structure on the mappings graph as defined by `type_ordering`. Then we only allow auto-mappings between `A` and `C` if the `ABC` path is a minor of the mappings tree.

The rules themselves come in two varieties: regular and attribute-link.

### Regular rules
Regular rules are defined by `Rule(name, top, mid, bottom)` where name is the for-humans name of the rule and top/mid/bottom are types or sets of types. Their names correspond to the positioning in the mapping tree.

#### Example
`Rule("example rule", "Program", "Regulation", "Objective")`

The above rule will fire in two cases:

- a program `p` is mapped to a regulation `r` and the user adds a mapping between `r` and an objective `o`. In this case the rule implies mapping `p` to `o`.
- a regulation `r` is mapped to an objective `o` and the user adds a mapping between `r` and a program `p`. In this case the rule implies mapping `p` to `o`.

Any or all types can be replaced by sets of type. This generates rules for the cross product of sets.

### Attribute-link rules

Attribute-link rules regard special mappings that are not a part of the `relationships` table.
They are defined by specifying the attribute that links to the relevant object in an `Attr` instance.

#### Example
`Rule("example rule", Attr("directive"), "Section", "Objective")`

The above rule will only fire in on case. When an objective `o` is mapped to a section `s` it will map `o` to directive `d` accessible through `s`'s `directive` attribute.
